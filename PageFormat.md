# Page Formatting Guidelines

While we do want you to make your pages your own, it also helps the readability of this project if we can all try to stay within a guideline when it comes to formatting. Pages will be using markdown, which helps curate our cohesive a lot. Below are some common best-practices when writing your counterarguments.

Try to use a Header 1 (#) to denote the main category of discussion. Use Header 2's to section out individual FUD lines. Also, wrap the FUD line in quotes, and frame it as something someone might say while spreading FUD.

**Example:**

# Energy Usage (header 1 - category)
## "Bitcoin Uses Too Much Energy" (header 2 - FUD)

The use of **Bold** and *Italic* formatting is more open-ended. In general, we tend to like **Bold** words being used to denote smaller section titles and *Italics* being used to apply emphasis on a word or phrase.

**Example:**

When people say Bitcoin uses "too much energy", it's important to first understand what is being deemed as "too much".

**World's Energy Output**
The world's total energy consumption is "x/kwh". That is over *x-times* the amount of Bitcoin. In other words, Bitcoin only uses *less than x%* of the total energy output of the world.

Quotes are used to highlight parts of a linked source & link to it. Try not to include too much of the source, and pull out only what is necessary to highlight.

**Example:**

When compared to the world's overall energy usage, it's important to point out Bitcoin's use as a currency. Comparing it to other currencies, we see the real energy savings begin to show:
> The total cost of the US banking system is estimated to be around x/kwh. This includes several factors such as production of physical cash, transportation, employee emissions, and storage.

When linking to an outside resource, use the title of the article/study followed by a dash and then the publisher. Using a domain name in place of an unknown official name is ok.

You can either link at the end of a quote (on a new line) after highlighting some text from the resource, or you can add a footnote tag using square brackets, and then linking them directly after your arguments (not in a footer, but instead right after the paragraph that contains the footnote).

**Example:**

The study found this claim to be false [1]. There are numerous ways to observe this finding, and it requires us to consider what type of energy usage is worth it compared to the utility it provides.

The use of `code` blocks is a case-by-case basis, but is usually used to denote code.

Lines and dividers should be avoided.

Images should be used sparingly and should relate in a beneficial way to the text-material (ie a graph or a diagram, but not a screenshot of text - for that, use the quote block).
