# FudFree.Wiki
> a handy pocket guide to countering FUD

## How It Works
This is an open-participation wiki. To help keep things organized, we use issues to track "Open FUD Topics". See some FUD floating around out there in mainstream discourse? Add it as an issue so we can track its page contribution.

If you want to counter some FUD, fork this repo and add a markdown page. You can also clone this repo locally and then create a new branch for your page if you prefer that method. In the beginning, I'll be manually adding in contributions while we organize categories.

If you don't want to use Git, feel free to email me your contribution at [hax@sent.as](mailto:hax@sent.as). Just let me know what you would like your credit to be (name & link).

We have some general tips on formatting your page in [`PageFormat.md`](PageFormat.md).

## The Vibe
This is meant to be an educational resource that improves our knowledge. This is not meant to serve as a host of "easy dunks" on those spreading FUD. We should write our counter-arguments in a civil manner and not act defensive. If you truly believe in what you write, then you won't be afraid to have it challenged & tested.

High-quality sources should be included for any non-obvious answers. Ideally, your page will look like an ELI5 summary of source-backed factual answers. Don't try to write your thesis here. Keep it in the theme of "pocket-sized-rebuttal".

## Who, What, Where, When, Why
This project was spearheaded by [hax.btc](https://owl.link/hax.btc) and [thedoc.btc](https://twitter.com/CarlsonDoc). It is open to everyone who wants to contribute. You will be credited in your pages, along with all other editors.

Someday, this may end up in your physical pocket! But until then, this repo will serve as the main homepage. There's also a plan to eventually enable you to pick & choose which topics you want to include for a printable pamphlet.

The aim of this project is to serve as a community-lead knowledge-base that dispels rumors around Bitcoin, Stacks, and crypto/blockchain technology in general.

Keep your counter-FUD contributions tailored to technology specific complaints. Don't write pages talking about a specific project, organization, or individual. This is not a platform to promote anything other than facts.
